# brutus

Write. Test. Debug.

Copy the file over to somewhere easy to use. Add that directory to your path if not already there

Usage for `example-usage/`:

``` sh
brutus.py -g testcase-generator.py -o output -s runcmd
```

Things I still plan on doing:

- add this to PyPI
- add support for multiprocessing
- refactor
- use IO streams instead of strings
- add a CLI option for number of tests
